#  RaspberryPiMonitor client

Currently this repo is just a playground for a proof of concept for a RPi audio/video (baby) monitor project.

The project is:
1. RPi Zero device which grabs the audio and video feed and broadcast it over known local wifi (or ad-hoc created one).
2. Various clients within the local network (or RPi created) which reads the feed and display it to the user.

This is a repo where I can fiddle around the iOS app so the old iPad Mini maybe will be recycled as a main client device for it.
